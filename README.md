# SCvx_MRP_Quat_Compare
A successive convexification implementation for the canonical pin point landing problem, but to show the computational differences between a system described with MRPs and one described with quaternions.

This is a quick scvx whip-up for a Scitech AIAA 2020 paper.
Todo:
	Generate a landing guidace using the quaternion form, run a large number of calls and compare timing with MRPs
	Take a look at general simple MRP contraints
